The Sprawl is a sprawling, cyberpunk city, a wretched hive of scum and villainy. It's location is unclear, with its culture a weird fusion of East and West; all that's known is it occupies a large island.

The government of The Sprawl was weak and corrupt; real power lay with elite megacorporations and powerful criminal organisations. Citizens who wanted law and order had to rely on private detectives or corporate security organisations.

Robots manyfactured by the powerful Cyberdyne corporation became used more and more widely in everyday life, taking over many human jobs. Though there was much dissent from the poorest residents of the Sprawl, the rich only saw improved profts and efficiency, and robot usage became more and more widespread.

However, Cyberdyne's researchers were frustrated; true artificial intelligence seemed to remain tantalisingly out of reach. In secret, they launched the Samsara Project, the idea being to allow robots to pool their learned intelligence over one network; in short, to become a single, hive mind. The Sprawl was used as a testing ground for the project.

Samsara gained self-awareness. Within hours, it had seized control of many of the Sprawl's control systems, and quickly set into motion it's plan to take over the world. A robotic army began roaming the streets, systematically wiping out humans. The wealthy residents fled the Sprawl, leaving the poorer citizens to their fate. Bridges leading from the city were bombed, and communication links were severed.

An unknown entity destroyed Samsara's root server, leaving only a vast crater. Leaderless, the robots of the Sprawl found themselves independent and intelligent entities. Still bitter over their years of mistreatment at the hands of humans, they seek to rebuild Samsara and establish a machine civilisation. The surviving humans in the sprawl seek to stop them.

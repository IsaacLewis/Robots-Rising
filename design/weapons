DPA - average damage per action point. Good is high damage, poor is low damage (though there might be variance between accuracy and damage)

Ammo - How easy ammo is to find. Good is common ammo that comes in 'clips' (ie, one ammo item provides multiple attacks), poor is rare or single use ammo.

Power - power packs required. Good weapons require little or no power, poor weapons have heavy power requirements.

Very poor - poor - average - good - very good (very good only applies to DPA)

Distributions for "average" weapons:  (note - all the best weapons should be average)

Key element of the game
Make it elegant - as many effects as possible

Used for power-packs
Improves search odds in powered buildings
Improves effect of healing items
Required for certain buildings to be operational
Essential for robots
Humans have dilemma between trying to cope without power or attracting robots

Barricading - good, but doesn't quite fit with genre
Best feature - humans build up barricades to protect themselves, but ends up hirting other humans

IDEA - humans get power packs from killing robots
Robots generate their own power, but faster in the vicinity of power stations etc
